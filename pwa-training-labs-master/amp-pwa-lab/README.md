# AMP and PWA

In this lab, youâ€™ll convert an app containing AMP pages into a PWA using two different patterns:

1. transform an AMP site into a PWA (AMP as PWA)
2. use the App Shell architecture to create a PWA that uses AMP as content (AMP in PWA)

AMP+PWA gives you the best of both worlds: a lightning fast first load with AMP, and native-like capabilities in the PWA.

You'll also get a chance to use [Workbox](https://workboxjs.org/).

## Getting started

Instructions, as well as lecture videos and related content, are available on [developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/). The instructions can also be accessed on [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/google-developer-training/progressive-web-apps-ilt-codelabs/details), where they are available as a [downloadable PDF](https://www.gitbook.com/download/pdf/book/google-developer-training/progressive-web-apps-ilt-codelabs).
